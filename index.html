  &nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp    ABOUT ME</i></h1></b></p>
 
  <p><h3><i>My name is BOI DANQUAH BERTRAM, I come from Kwame Danso, located in the 
  Bone East region
  of Ghana. I am a boy of nineteen years of age, I started  my primary school from the Seventh Day Adventist
  known as SDA. I stopped schooling in that school and I continued my schooling in 
  Zephonel Educational Complex.
 <p><h3><i> After I completed   school in Zephonel Educational Complex, 
 I was enrolled in to 
  Ameyaw Senior High And Technical 
  School, located in Techiman in the Bono East Region of Ghana. I was given the chance to study
  general science 
as my program of study. I was able to comply by the rules and regulations of the school, I did my 
possible best as required as a student
and God being on my side, I was able to make all the necessary grades after I wrote my final exams
 in my second cycle of education.
I didn't find it easy although, because life wasn't easy by then. Glory to HIS name that i didn't perish.
I was able to overcome all the challenges and all the afflictions that came my way.
</h3></i></p> 
 <p><i><h3>After i completed my second cycle education, I had the opportunity to enter into the university 
 in that same year. I was enrolled in to the University of Ghana to study BSc physical science and 
  I belong to the collage of basic and applied sciences.</i></h3></p>
 <p><i><h3> And here in the university,I was told. I was told by most people that life in university 
  is simple, enjoyable, and many other things, they are all true although, but not to how they told me,
  its true, that you can decide to go for lectures, you can decide not to go, no one would ever force you to go for lectures     
 </h3></i></p>
 <p><i><h3>Upon all the stress in the university, we I am still doing my best to make sure I get myself fixed in it to make me acheive my aims and goals as well
 and I hope that the Lord that paved a way for me to enter into this university would continued to be with me 
 to have a successful stay and a better class class.</i><h3></p>
